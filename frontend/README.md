## Frontend placeholder

This `frontend/` directory is reserved for a future Next.js application that will consume the NestJS backend in `backend/`.

Planned stack:

- Next.js (App Router)
- TypeScript
- React Query or SWR for data fetching
- Authentication via JWT (using the `/api/auth` endpoints from the backend)

For now, no frontend code is implemented.
